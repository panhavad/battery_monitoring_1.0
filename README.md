# Battery Monitoring 1.0 for Network's Antenna

In order to get internet connection to supply the whole vKirirom resort, network department is totally dependent on internet signal received by an antenna placed on the top of the mountain which can not supply electricity there by wire. So network department decided to use solar panel and battery but there were certain problem that cause the lost of internet supply to vKirirom such as Battery is empty without knowing. So this project is created to solve that problem by monitoring the battery power remotely.
During the initial creation of the Network Battery Monitoring V1.0 we are targeting a specific goal to achieve in this version such as:
Live monitoring of each battery power
Alert to the responsible person when the battery power reaches a certain level
Able to transfer battery information through ethernet
60% of the programming configuration should be able to customize through network.
Finally, after all the hard work, and the help from network department team. I am able to understand what the problem is, what they need, and what are all the constraints I have to handle during do the project. On 12 October 2019 Network Battery Monitoring V1.0 was indoor tested and satisfy by Mr.Nget Phanny.
